# JSPractice
This is my first practice with JavaScript.
I made use of various functions.
I used String Manipulation Functions to:
 1. Write a function that reverses a given string.
 2. Create a function that counts the number of characters in a string.
 3. Implement a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a sentence.

I also used Array Functions to:
 1. Write functions to find the maximum and minimum values in an array of numbers.
 2. Create a function that calculates the sum of all elements in an array.
 3. Implement a function that filters out elements from an array based on a given condition.

I also used Mathematical Functions to:
 1. Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
 2. Create a function to check if a number is prime or not.
 3. Implement a function to generate the Fibonacci sequence up to a given number of terms.

Though I do not undersand all that I did, especially the Fibonacci function, I hope with more practice and research, I can get further clarification.
